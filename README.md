SIMPLE SHELL
This is a simple shell program that provides a basic command-line interface for users to execute commands. It supports executing both built-in commands and external commands by forking a new process.

GETTING STARTED
To use this shell, simply compile the source code and run the resulting executable. You can also use the Makefile provided to automate the compilation process.
Once you launch the shell, you can type in commands and execute them by pressing Enter. The shell will then execute the command and display the output, if any.

FEATURES
This shell currently supports the following features:
* Executing built-in commands such as cd, help, exit
* Executing external commands by forking a new process
* Handling command-line arguments and options
* Input/output redirection using the < and > operators
* Piping multiple commands together using the | operator
